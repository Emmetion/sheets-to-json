Another idea is that Ithamar Strong build a cider mill on the Island in 1778 and had to pay Northampton half of his profits. The presence of the apple trees would raise the value of the land Hull's house was on, and the chance to take a big cut of the income from those trees would be a motivation for Northampton to seize land that they could claim was legally theirs to begin with. Finally, Philemon Lee, Bathsheba's second husband, had expressed interest in buying property in Northampton. If he could have made an offer to purchase the lot, it would have been taken from the town.
